# Recon — Penetration Testing Reconnaissance

Perform structured reconnaissance against an authorized target, organizing findings into an actionable attack surface map.

Cross-references: `osint-recon` for the deeper open-source-intelligence pass (people, organizations, historical data) — this skill is the active/passive target-mapping side, osint-recon is the broader investigative side; they pair naturally. `web-pentest` for the next stage once recon has produced an attack surface map and an authorized target list. `owasp-audit` for source-code review when you have access to the target's code.

## Authorization Check

Before running any commands, confirm:
1. The user has written authorization for the target (pentest engagement, bug bounty program, CTF/lab environment)
2. The target is within the defined scope

If authorization is unclear, ask before proceeding. Never assume authorization.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Passive Recon

Gather information without touching the target directly.

**DNS enumeration:**
- Run `dig any $ARGUMENTS` for A, AAAA, MX, TXT, NS, CNAME records
- Attempt zone transfer: `dig axfr @ns-server $ARGUMENTS`
- Enumerate subdomains via certificate transparency:
  ```
  curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%25.$ARGUMENTS&output=json" | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sort -u
  ```

**WHOIS and registration:** Run `whois $ARGUMENTS` for registrant, nameserver, and creation date info.

**Search engine dorking:** Use targeted queries — `site:`, `inurl:`, `filetype:`, `intitle:` — to find exposed pages, documents, and admin panels.

**Technology fingerprinting:** Identify frameworks, CMS, server software, and JavaScript libraries from public-facing pages.

**Public code repositories:** Search GitHub/GitLab for the target's org name, domain, API keys, or internal paths.

**Historical data:** Check the Wayback Machine for old endpoints, removed pages, and configuration files.

### Phase 2: Active Recon (explicit authorization only)

**Port scanning:**
```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN scan-results.txt $ARGUMENTS
```
Start with top 1000 ports. Expand to full range (`-p-`) if needed. Use `-Pn` if the host appears down but is in scope.

**Service enumeration:** Based on open ports, probe for version info and default configurations.

**Web content discovery:**
- Directory bruting with gobuster, feroxbuster, or dirsearch
- Virtual host enumeration
- API endpoint discovery (check `/api/`, `/v1/`, `/graphql`, `/swagger.json`)

**SSL/TLS analysis:** Run `testssl.sh` or `sslyze` to check for weak ciphers, expired certificates, and misconfigurations.

### Phase 3: Analysis

Correlate all findings. Identify the most promising attack vectors and prioritize by:
1. Severity of potential impact
2. Likelihood of exploitation
3. Exposure level (internet-facing vs. internal)

## Output Format

Produce a structured recon report:

```markdown
# Recon Report
## Target: [target]
## Scope: [confirmed scope]
## Date: [date]

### Passive Findings
| Finding | Details | Relevance |
|---------|---------|-----------|

### Subdomains Discovered
- [list]

### Technologies Detected
- [list with versions where identified]

### Active Findings
| Port | Service | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|

### Attack Surface Summary
[Prioritized list of interesting findings with risk assessment]

### Recommended Next Steps
[Ordered list of what to investigate further]
```

## Boundaries

- Stay within the defined scope — never scan adjacent or out-of-scope systems
- Rate-limit aggressive scans to avoid disruption
- Log all commands run for the engagement record
- If you discover evidence of active compromise by a third party, alert the user immediately
- Refuse requests targeting systems without explicit authorization
- Refuse requests for mass scanning of unrelated targets
